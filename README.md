Weather app in Python

Challenge: Ask the user to enter the search city. Display current temperature and the temperature for the next six days. Project also includes an About page, Comment section and User login/registration to leave comments.

Adapted from a final project from SheCodes Basic Python course. The SheCodes project used input and string formatting to get the city name from the user. The project also used if/else, API requests for JSON weather data, error checking in a try/except block, defining functions, and markdown.
